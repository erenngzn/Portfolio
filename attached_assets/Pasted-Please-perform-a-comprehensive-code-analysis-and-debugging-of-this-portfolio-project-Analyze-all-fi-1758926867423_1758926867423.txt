Please perform a comprehensive code analysis and debugging of this portfolio project. Analyze all files systematically and fix any errors, bugs, or issues you find.

## PRIORITY FIXES NEEDED:

**1. Process Animation Improvements**
- EXTEND the duration of process animations to make them more realistic
- Ensure ALL process steps animate smoothly and sequentially 
- Add proper timing delays between each animation step
- Make animations feel natural and professional, not rushed

**2. Export Modal Close Button**
- CHANGE the close button color from white to RED for better visibility
- Ensure the close button stands out against the modal background
- Test button hover states and accessibility

**3. PDF CV File Display Issue**
- FIX the uploaded PDF CV file not showing on the portfolio page
- Implement proper PDF file handling and display
- Add PDF viewer or download link functionality
- Ensure CV is properly integrated into the portfolio layout

**4. General Code Cleanup & Compilation**
- Consolidate and organize all code files
- Remove any redundant or unused code
- Ensure all components work together seamlessly
- Fix any compilation or runtime errors

## DIAGNOSTIC TASKS:

**1. Code Analysis**
- Scan all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for syntax errors
- Check for undefined variables and functions
- Identify broken references and missing dependencies
- Validate HTML structure and semantic correctness
- Review CSS for invalid properties or selectors

**2. JavaScript Debugging**
- Fix all console errors and warnings
- Repair broken event listeners and handlers
- Resolve scope and variable declaration issues
- Fix async/await and Promise-related problems
- Ensure proper DOM manipulation and element selection

**3. Functionality Testing**
- Test all interactive elements (buttons, forms, inputs)
- Verify animations work with EXTENDED timing
- Check modal/popup functionality with RED close button
- Ensure PDF CV displays correctly
- Validate form submissions and data handling

**4. UI/UX Issues**
- Fix responsive design problems
- Resolve styling inconsistencies
- Repair broken layouts or overlapping elements
- Ensure proper text visibility and contrast
- Fix any visual glitches or display issues

## SPECIFIC AREAS TO CHECK:

- **Process Animations**: Extend duration, add realistic timing, ensure smooth step-by-step progression
- **Export Modal**: Red close button, proper sizing, full content visibility
- **PDF CV Integration**: File upload handling, display mechanism, user accessibility
- **Input/Form Fields**: Ensure text persistence and proper state management
- **Code Viewer**: Make sure content is properly scrollable
- **Navigation**: Check all links and routing work correctly
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Test on different screen sizes

## IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:

- PRIORITIZE the 4 main fixes listed above
- Fix errors without breaking existing functionality
- Maintain current design aesthetic and layout
- Use modern JavaScript ES6+ practices
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility
- Add proper error handling where needed
- Optimize performance and loading times
- Add comments for complex logic
- Create a fully functional, polished portfolio

## ANIMATION TIMING SPECIFICS:

- Increase process animation duration to at least 3-5 seconds per step
- Add 500-800ms delays between each animation phase
- Use smooth easing functions (ease-in-out, cubic-bezier)
- Ensure each process step is clearly visible before moving to next

## PDF INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS:

- Add PDF viewer using iframe or PDF.js library
- Create download button for CV file
- Display CV preview thumbnail or icon
- Handle PDF loading errors gracefully

## OUTPUT:

After analysis, please:
1. List all errors/issues found (especially the 4 priority items)
2. Implement fixes for each problem systematically
3. Test ALL functionality thoroughly
4. Ensure portfolio is production-ready
5. Provide a summary of changes made

Please start by examining the project structure and addressing the priority fixes first.
